# Introduction to .NET

## üìå What is .NET?

- .NET is an application development platform to build various applications.
- It is not a single language, but an integration of multiple languages.
- Applications that can be built:
  - Desktop Applications
  - Web Applications
  - Mobile Applications

Microsoft introduced .NET in 2000.

- Public version released in 2002 as a free software download.
- Provides a development platform with managed execution.

## üì± Types of Applications in .NET

### 1. Desktop Applications (Standalone Applications)

- Run locally on the desktop.
- Examples: Calculator, Notepad, Accounting Software, Supermarket Billing.
- May or may not require internet.
- Must be installed on every user machine.

---

### 2. Web Applications

- Hosted on a server, accessed via browser (client devices).
- Examples: Google, Facebook, E-commerce apps.
- Interacts with databases for storing/retrieving data.

---

### 3. Mobile Applications

- Phone-based applications that can be installed on iOS or Android.
- Built using .NET frameworks and tools.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Components of .NET

- CLR (Common Language Runtime)
  - Core component of .NET.
  - Provides secure and managed execution.
  - Ensures performance and memory management.

- CLI (Common Language Infrastructure)
  - Standard specification for building and executing code.
  - Supports multiple languages.

- CLS (Common Language Specification)
  - Rules that ensure cross-language interoperability.

## ‚úÖ Benefits of .NET

- Secure execution environment (via CLR).
- High performance for applications.
- Supports multiple languages (30+ including C#, VB, VC++).
- Supports multiple application types (desktop, web, mobile).
- Code reusability through services (internal or public APIs).

## üñ•Ô∏è Types of Applications using C#

C# with .NET mainly supports 3 application types:

1. Windows GUI Applications
   - Applications with graphical components (buttons, labels, text boxes).
   - Example: Calculator, Supermarket billing systems.
   - Must be installed on every machine (e.g., MS Office).

2. Windows Services
   - Background process applications.
   - Example: Sending automated emails, cleaning databases.
   - No GUI (run silently in background).

3. Console Applications
   - Command-line based input/output.
   - Example: Small utility programs run in Command Prompt.

## üåê Applications using ASP.NET

1. Websites (Static Web Content)
   - Collection of static pages (mostly informational).
   - Example: College or University websites.

2. Web Applications (Dynamic Web Content)
   - Content changes dynamically using databases.
   - Examples:
     - News websites (content updates frequently)
     - E-commerce apps
     - Social networking sites

3. Web Services
   - Reusable programs hosted on servers.
   - Accessible across multiple applications.
   - Used for reusability and inter-application communication.

## üìå Key Notes

- .NET = Technology platform (not just a language).
- CLR = Heart of .NET for secure, managed execution.
- C# = Most widely used .NET language.
- Types of applications: Desktop, Web, Mobile.
- Using C#: Windows GUI, Services, Console Apps.
- Using ASP.NET: Websites, Web Apps, Web Services.
